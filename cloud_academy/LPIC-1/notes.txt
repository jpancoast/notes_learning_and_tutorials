LPIC-1 101 Linux Partitions and Filesystems (5 of 5):
	MBR partitions limited to 4 primary partitions and disks of less than 2 TB
	GPT partitions not available on all bios
	fdisk for MBR partitions
	parted or gdisk for GPT partitions

	mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc

	mkswap/mkreiserfs

	df -i lists inode usage
	df -T lists partition type

	dumpe2fs /dev/xvda1

	tune2fs tunes the FS (checks, etc.)

	fsck/e2fsck

	debugfs

	mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb-drive (ex)
	umount

	fstab

	Permissions:
		r/w/x read/write/execute
		u/g/o user/group/others
		Octal: read: 4 
			   write: 2
			   executable: 1
		The number between the perms and the owner is the number of hardlinks

		sudo chmod o-w filename (remove write from others)

		s (suid bit)
			sudo chmod u+s 

		directory prevent others from deleting:
			"sticky bit" chmod +t /ourfiles

		guid: chmod g+s

		umask: affects default permissions on created files. (basically 777-umask)

	"FHS" Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

	'sbin': system binaries is what it means. I never knew that.

	finding files:
		sudo find /etc/ -name *.conf
		locate / updatedb
		whereis / which / type

	ln -s <what you want to link too> <Where you want the link to be>

	symlinks: different inode(s)
		ln -s /bin/cp ~/
		can be id'd throught he 'l'
	hardlinks: share inode(s)
		ln ~/stuff1 ~/files/
		appears like any other file.

	Disk Quotas:
		quotacheck -avmug
		quotaon / repquota / edquota
